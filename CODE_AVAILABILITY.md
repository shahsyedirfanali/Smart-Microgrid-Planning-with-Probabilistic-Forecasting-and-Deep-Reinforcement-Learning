This repo contains all three modules referenced in the manuscript:
- Forecasting (CNNâ€“LSTM + PSO + optional quantile regression)
- Optimization (NSGA-II with Monte-Carlo scenarios)
- EMS (DQN and PPO agents in a gym-like environment)

Each script writes the exact configuration used to `artifacts/` for repeatability.
